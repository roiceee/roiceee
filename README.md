### Ayo what's up. I'm John Roice Aldeza. 

#### Current stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS. 

I've been doing some toy web apps for some time. I'm still learning a lot of things. I currently know front-end web technologies.

I also know core Java and I'm planning to learn Spring after spending some time with React.
